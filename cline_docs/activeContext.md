# Active Development Context

## Current Focus
- Test coverage improvements for DatabaseService and ConnectionManager
- Implementation of robust error handling and recovery mechanisms

## Recent Changes
1. **Connection Manager Test Coverage (17/02/2025)**
   - Achieved 100% statement and line coverage (up from ~60%)
   - Improved branch coverage to 89.79% (up from 36.36%)
   - Added test for connection close failures
   - All error handling paths now covered
   - Implemented stress tests for connection pool

2. **Key Test Improvements**
   - Connection pool initialization retry logic
   - Transaction management error handling
   - Connection recovery mechanisms
   - Connection cleanup error scenarios

## Next Steps
1. **Performance Testing**
   - Implement benchmarks for:
     * Connection acquisition time
     * Transaction throughput
     * Recovery time measurements

2. **E2E Testing**
   - Real SQLite database interactions
   - File system error scenarios
   - Process crash recovery

## Current Status
- All core functionality tested ✓
- Error handling coverage complete ✓
- Stress tests implemented ✓
- Memory leak detection pending

## Technical Debt
1. Memory leak detection should be implemented
2. Performance regression tests needed
3. Documentation updates required for error handling scenarios

## Dependencies
- Jest test framework
- SQLite3 for database operations
- TypeScript for type safety
