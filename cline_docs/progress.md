## 15/02/2025
- Implemented robust test suite for database connection management
- Added stress tests for the ConnectionManager class
- Fixed connection pool exhaustion issues in tests
- Improved error handling for cleanup and connection failures

  - Database Service: 21 tests
  - Price Validation: 10 tests
  - Connection Manager (unit): 6 tests
  - Connection Manager (stress): 5 tests

## Next Steps
1. Phase 3 - Balance & Transaction Precision

## Upcoming Work
### Phase 3 - Balance & Transaction Precision
- [ ] BigNumber Library Integration
- [ ] Decimal Handling System
- [ ] Balance Reconciliation
- [ ] Enhanced Transaction Verification

### Phase 4 - Monitoring & Logging
- [ ] Price Source Operation Logging
- [ ] Price Feed Health Checks
- [ ] Database Connection Monitoring
- [ ] Metrics Collection System

## Known Issues
1. ~~Potential race conditions in sell operations~~ (Partially addressed by price validation)
2. Precision issues in balance calculations
3. Limited error handling in price source switching
4. No transaction locking mechanism
5. Basic monitoring capabilities

## Testing Status
- Basic functionality tests complete
- Price validation system tested with multiple scenarios
- Need integration tests for database improvements
- Performance testing required for database improvements

## Latest Updates
- Added price validation system with rolling averages
- Implemented cross-validation between price sources
- Added confidence scoring for price validity
- Added fallback mechanisms for price source failures
