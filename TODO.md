Last updated: 17/02/2025

### Current Coverage Stats ✨
- Statements: 100% (was 59.52%)
- Branches: 89.79% (was 36.36%)
- Functions: 100% (was 61.9%)
- Lines: 100% (was 61.03%)

### Previously Uncovered Lines - Now Covered ✓
- Lines 43: Connection pool initialization retry logic ✓
- Lines 95, 103-104: Connection management in transaction method ✓
- Lines 117-147: Error handling and retries in executeWithRetry method ✓
- Lines 164-190: Transaction and cleanup operations (includes recoverConnection and closeAll) ✓

### Completed Tasks ✓

1. **Connection Pool Management**
   - Pool size limits and configuration tests implemented
   - Initialization retry logic tests implemented
   - Connection recovery tests implemented
   - Connection close error handling tests added

2. **Error Handling & Recovery**
   - Connection timeout tests implemented
   - Database locked scenarios tested
   - Unrecoverable connection handling tested
   - Error propagation verified

3. **Transaction Management**
   - Transaction rollback tests implemented
   - Error handling in transactions verified
   - Connection cleanup after failures tested

4. **Stress Testing**
   - High concurrency tests implemented
   - Connection pool exhaustion tests added
   - Recovery mechanisms verified

### Remaining Improvements

#### Performance Optimization
1. Consider implementing performance benchmarks:
   - Connection acquisition time
   - Transaction throughput
   - Recovery time measurements

#### Additional Testing
1. Add E2E tests with:
   - Real SQLite database interactions
   - File system error scenarios
   - Process crash recovery

#### Documentation
1. Update API documentation with:
   - Error handling examples
   - Recovery strategies
   - Best practices for connection management

### Notes
- Branch coverage improved from 36.36% to 89.79%
- All critical paths now have test coverage
- Error handling scenarios thoroughly tested
- Memory leak detection should be considered for future improvements

### Dependencies
- Jest for test framework
- SQLite3 for database operations
- TypeScript for type safety

Last tested with Node.js v18.x
